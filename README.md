ASP.NET Core is a cross-platform, high-performance, open-source framework for building modern, cloud-enabled, Internet-connected apps.

With ASP.NET Core, you can:

Build web apps and services, Internet of Things (IoT) apps, and mobile backends.
Use your favorite development tools on Windows, macOS, and Linux.
Deploy to the cloud or on-premises.
Run on .NET.


**Why choose ASP.NET Core?**
Millions of developers use or have used ASP.NET 4.x to create web apps. ASP.NET Core is a redesign of ASP.NET 4.x, including architectural changes that result in a leaner, more modular framework.

ASP.NET Core provides the following benefits:

A unified story for building web UI and web APIs.
Architected for testability.
Razor Pages makes coding page-focused scenarios easier and more productive.
Blazor lets you use C# in the browser alongside JavaScript. Share server-side and client-side app logic all written with .NET.
Ability to develop and run on Windows, macOS, and Linux.
Open-source and community-focused.
Integration of modern, client-side frameworks and development workflows.
Support for hosting Remote Procedure Call (RPC) services using gRPC.
A cloud-ready, environment-based configuration system.
Built-in dependency injection.
A lightweight, high-performance, and modular HTTP request pipeline.
Ability to host on the following:
Kestrel
IIS
HTTP.sys
Nginx
Docker
Side-by-side versioning.
Tooling that simplifies modern web development.


**ASP.NET Core target frameworks**
ASP.NET Core 3.x or later can only target .NET.

There are several advantages to targeting .NET, and these advantages increase with each release. Some advantages of .NET over .NET Framework include:

Cross-platform. Runs on Windows, macOS, and Linux.
Improved performance
Side-by-side versioning
New APIs
